That is one of the reasons we complain. Sometimes with complaining, we lose what we think it would be for us forever; we break the light we own when we do not see its value, and we see its value when there is no way to return it because we had already lost it. It is something nice to see people are grateful for what they have, but it would be great if they keep looking for more to get and to share some with others. On the other part, there are people, they are just complaining about what they are missing without planning or working to get what they need. They should ask themselves this question; what they get from complaining? Some help? Life is not a place for those who see just the darkness, there is a light as well; which one you say “hi” to, that one will say “welcome” to you! So choose the one you want. As a result, I invite you to watch videos on my Youtube channel in order to get benefits.
