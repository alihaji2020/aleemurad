I study at an International University in Europe called LCC international university. I am a person who loves life deeply, and I believe that there is much more in life we cannot be aware of if we do not decide to. From this point, I started my Youtube channel. I thought I could spread some positivity around. I had a difficult experience living in Iraq which made me to think about happiness in life and the reason for being alive. I am a deep-thinking person looking for a better life to experience and share what I perceive with others. I believe in nature, and my mind is open to any change that makes sense in order to have a good life experience because everything for me is to have a fun, joyful and amazing life even there are not easy life-moments generally, but my goal is and will be ever looking for a good life and spreading positivity around.
